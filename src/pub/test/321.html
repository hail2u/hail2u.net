    <section class="amaranth">
      <h1>Amaranth</h1>
      <p>The Amaranth family is a friendly upright italic design with a slight contrast and distinctive curves. With its three new styles Amaranth is healthy for all your texts too!</p>

    <section class="arvo">
      <h1>Arvo</h1>
      <p>Arvo is a geometric slab-serif typeface family suited for screen and print. The family includes 4 cuts: Roman, Italic, Roman Bold, Bold Italic. It is a open font distributed through the Google Font Directory. The flavour of the font is rather mixed. Its monolinearish, but has tiny bit of contrast (which increases the legibility a little in Mac OS X.) The name Arvo is a typical Estonian man's name, but is not used widely any more. In the Finnish language, Arvo means "number, value, worth." Considering how much programming is behind hinting, 'number' is also true.</p>

    <section class="cabin-sketch">
      <h1>Cabin Sketch</h1>
      <p>The Cabin Font is a humanist sans inspired by Edward Johnston’s and Eric Gill’s typefaces, with a touch of modernism.</p>

    <section class="terminal-dosis">
      <h1>Terminal Dosis</h1>
      <p>Terminal Dosis is a rounded sans-serif type family. It started with the Extra Light style, useful only at size 36pt or upm and the Extended Latin character set included many alternative characters, all designed by Edgar Tolentino and Pablo Impallari.</p>

    <section class="vollkorn">
      <h1>Vollkorn</h1>
      <p>Vollkorn came into being as my first type designing attempt. I published the Regular in 2005 under a Creative-Commons-License. Until the counter finally collapsed two years later it had been downloaded thousands of times and used for web and print matters. It intends to be a quiet, modest and well working text face for bread and butter use. Unlike its examples in the book faces from the renaissance until today, it has dark and meaty serifs and a bouncing and healthy look. It might be used as body type as well as for headlines or titles. »Vollkorn« (pronounced »Follkorn«) is German for »wholemeal« which refers to the old term »Brotschrift«. It stood for the small fonts for every day use in hand setting times.</p>
