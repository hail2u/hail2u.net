    <p class="test">Reids Flat is a small historic village (population 50) sited on the south bank of the Lachlan River, approximately 40 kilometres southeast of Wyangala Dam, in the northeastern corner of Boorowa Shire, in the South West Slopes region of New South Wales, hidden in the Great Dividing Range.</p>

    <p class="test">The village – now largely a quiet residential area – no longer has any commercial establishments within its boundaries; the nearest shop is located 22 kilometres away, in the town of Bigga. It does, however, possess a small public school, a public hall, a showground, and a council rubbish dump.</p>
