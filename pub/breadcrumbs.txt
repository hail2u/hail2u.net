=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: breadcrumbs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Populates $breadcrumbs::breadcrumbs with a clickable trail to
your current path in the weblog hierarchy (a la Yahoo!).

e.g. a/path/to/somewhere becomes 
<a href="/a">a</a> :: <a href="/a/path">path</a> :: ...

Optionally prepends the path with a link back to home.  Alter $home
as you please, leaving it blank to turn off the link to home.

=head1 VERSION

2003-12-29

Version number coincides with the version of Blosxom with which the 
current version was first bundled.
